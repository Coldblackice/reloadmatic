<strong>Highlights</strong>
Ready for FF 57.0. "Smart timing" feature prevents scheduled reloads from accidentially interrupting the user. Ability to set custom reload intervals. Ability to reload with caches disabled, once or repeatedly. Support refreshing POST data after form submission. Support for tab restore. Randomized intervals. Remember settings for given page. No restart needed after installation or upgrade.

<strong>Usage</strong>
To use this add-on, simply right-click anywhere in a webpage and select options under "Reload" of the context menu. Users of the addon "ReloadEvery" will find the interface very familiar. In contrast to ReloadEvery though a tab will stop reloading if you navigate away to a different page in the same tab. To keep reloading even in that case, enable the "Sticky reload" option. Clicking on a tab header is not yet possible due to limitations of the new WebExtensions API, but will be added as soon as technically feasible.

<strong>Description of Options</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Remember page</b> - When enabled, settings will be remembered and activated whenever the same webpage is loaded. Settings are stored per page.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Randomize</b> - When enabled, the page will reload at random intervals between 0.5x and 1.5x of the period selected, instead of the exact period.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Only if unsuccessful</b> - When enabled, the page will only keep reloading if it cannot be loaded due to a network or server-side error.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Smart timing</b> - When enabled, automatic reloading will be delayed on an as-needed basis for a short time to prevent interrupting the user in his actions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Sticky reload</b> - Normally, when a user navigates away from a page, periodic reloading will be disabled for that tab until re-enabled again by the user. This is on purpose. Enabling this option will keep reloading turned on even if the page changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Disable cache</b> - When enabled, automatic reloads will force a full page reload by skipping the browser's local cache.

<strong>What are the permissions used for?</strong>
When you install this plugin, your browser will ask for the following permissions.
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Access your data for all websites</b> - The permission will allow ReloadMatic to retrieve HTTP status codes which is used to tell if the page was loaded successfully. Used for the "Only if unsuccessful" feature. Also needed to capture POST data for resubmission.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Access browser tabs</b> - It allows to associate and differentiate settings per tab, for example to keep a different reload period for each of your tabs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Access recently closed tabs</b> - Allows to restore reload- and other settings if you reopen an accidentially closed tab.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Access browser activity during navigation</b> - Used to catch navigation events, so that page reloading can be toggled on/off based on user actions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Access browsing history</b> - There are some pages that cannot be reloaded properly without adding new (unwanted) items to your browser history. This permission allows the addon to readjust your history in such cases to keep it tidy and correct.
    </li>
</ul>
